# Heart Disease Classification

## Project Description
The project focuses on Heart Disease data gathered from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease), from the year 1988. The data was collected from two clinics - Cleveland and VA Long Beach.

The goal of the project using the data on heart disease is to diagnose patients based on a multitude of factors. Diagnosis is classified on whether there is an absence or presence of heart disease. We also want to find out if specific factors, or features, affect the prediction score or accuracy as a comparison. 

In order to achieve this outcome, we used the following tools & platforms:
-	Python libraries (pandas, Matplotlib)
-	Machine Learning libraries (scikit-learn, Seaborn, TensorFlow)
-	PySpark
-	Tableau

We delved into three different visualisatons: 
- Sex vs. Age

## Heart Disease Classification 
- Reiterate and explain what was being classified
- Describe the models that were used
- Add reports/scores

## Conclusion
- Explain what was gathered from overall analysis of the Heart Disease data.
